## üü¢ Introduction

Welcome to the **HBnB** project!  
This repository contains the technical documentation, architecture diagrams, and sequence diagrams for the HBnB application, developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

The **HBnB project** is a full-stack web application that allows users to list, search, and review places.  
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the system‚Äôs architecture, main components, and API interaction flows.

## üü¶ High-Level Architecture

### üì¶ High-Level Package Diagram

![High-Level Package Diagram](part1/high_level_package.png)

#### üìù Explanations

- **Presentation Layer**: Manages user interaction and exposes APIs.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the main business logic and core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity).
- **Persistence Layer**: Handles all data storage and retrieval operations.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface between the presentation and business logic layers, simplifying communication.

## üü£ Class Relationships

- **User ‚Äî Place**:  
  A `User` can own multiple `Place` objects (`1` to `0..*`). This is shown by the **"owns"** relationship.

- **Place ‚Äî Review**:  
  A `Place` can have multiple `Review` objects (`1` to `0..*`). This is shown by the **"has"** relationship.

- **Place ‚Äî Amenity**:  
  There is a many-to-many relationship between `Place` and `Amenity` (`0..*` to `0..*`). This is shown by the **"offers"** or **"includes"** relationship.

> **Note:**  
> Multiplicity (`1`, `0..*`, etc.) is indicated at each end of the relationship lines in the class diagram.  
> The name of the relationship is placed above or below the line.

### üñºÔ∏è Class Diagram Example

## üü† Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Registration

![User Registration Sequence Diagram](part1/user_registration_sequence.png)

**Description:**  
Shows how a user registers for a new account. The request flows from the user to the API, then to the business logic, and finally to the database. The result is returned to the user.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Place Creation

![Place Creation Sequence Diagram](part1/place_creation.png)

**Description:**  
Illustrates the process when a user creates a new place listing. The request is validated and saved in the database, with the outcome sent back to the user.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Review Submission

![Review Submission Sequence Diagram](part1/review_submission.png)

**Description:**  
Represents the steps when a user submits a review for a place. The review is processed and stored in the database, and a response is returned to the user.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching a List of Places

![Fetching Places Sequence Diagram](part1/fetching_list_places.png)

**Description:**  
Shows how a user requests a list of places. The business logic queries the database, collects the results, and sends them back to the user through the API.
